## wxPerl

[wxPerl](http://wxperl.it), Perl bindings for wxWidgets

Started in 2000 and maintained for more than 10 years by me.  

## wxWidgets

[wxWidgets](http://www.wxwidgets.org) cross-platform GUI toolkit with
native look and feel.

I have been member of the
[development team](http://www.wxwidgets.org/about/whowhat.htm) with commit
privileges; I worked on the Motif port towards STL-compatibility
for the toolkit.

## Perl

One of the programming languages i like most.

I [maintain](https://metacpan.org/author/MBARBON) some
[CPAN](http://www.cpan.org) modules.

### ExtUtils::FakeConfig

A nice hack. To compile Perl modules the same compiler with which Perl
was compiled is required. With
[ExtUtils::FakeConfig](https://metacpan.org/module/ExtUtils::FakeConfig)
you can compile modules for ActivePerl on Win32 using the free
[MinGW GCC](http://www.mingw.org) compiler.

### ExtUtils::XSpp

Started as part of [wxPerl](http://wxperl.it) and currenly maintained by
Steffen MÃ¼ller, is a preprocessor that takes a C++-like header file
and produces output suitable for <tt>ExtUtils::ParseXS</tt>

[ExtUtils::XSpp](https://metacpan.org/module/ExtUtils::XSpp)

## Other

Some small projects on [GitHub](http://github.com/~mbarbon).
