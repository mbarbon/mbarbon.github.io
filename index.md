## Current position

Since February 2009 I work for Develer as a full-time employee.

## Bio sketch

I was born in Treviso (Italy, near Venice) January the 8th, 1979.

I obtained the "Laurea Specialistica in Informatica",
roughly equivalent to a MSc in Computer Science, October the 10th, 2003.

I work in IT as a developer. In my free time (which is becoming
less and less...) I participate to some Open Source projects.
