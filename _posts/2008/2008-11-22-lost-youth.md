Dedicated to Syntax Error.

Today I found the very first CD I mastered (actually,
<a href="http://giop.net/" target="_blank">Gioppino</a>
mastered it for me using La Fenice).  Apart from various demos,
modules, the technical manual of the 386 (plain text, with ASCII-art
graphs!) and assorted stuff, it contains the very first C/C++/Assembly
programs I wrote back in '96-'97.

So <a local="1" href="/julia">here it is</a> the one I was most
proud of: 255 bytes displaying an animation of the
<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set">Julia set</a>.
It ran pretty smooth back then, under DOS, on my Pentium 100,
and by the miracles on emulation it still runs pretty smooth as a boot sector
binary inside a VMWare.
