Description: Added Markdown support

I probably should bite the bullet and open a true blog somewhere else,
but since it only takes a bit of code and at the moment my priority
is to be able to edit the whole site while being offline, I added support for
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown">Markdown</a> markup
syntax for editing news entries.

The nice side effect is that I can still use Git to keep the revision
history for all the contents.
