Description: Added Markdown support

Probably should bite the bullet and open a true blog somewhere,
but since it only takes a bit of code and I really, really like
offline editing, I added support for
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) markup
syntax for editing news entries.

I will most likely convert the rest of the content to Markdown as
well.
