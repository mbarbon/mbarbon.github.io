Title: Got sick of Typo 3
Date-Rfc822: Mon, 17 Nov 2008 13:48:18 +0100
Description: Finally switched the site from Typo 3.

Not that Typo 3 is bad, but using it for this site is like killing a
fly with a nuclear bomb...  As a first step now the site is built using XML
+ XSLT; maybe I will add support for Wiki markup (or reStructuredText,
or Markdown, ...) later.
